# Angular - Advantages & Disadvantages

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular/angular-advantages-disadvantages.htm

Angular was launched in 2016 as a replacement for AngularJS and within a few months, it gained popularity among developers community, especially front-end developers due to its features and ease of use. Even today, it continues to be one of the popular frameworks because Google actively maintains, improves and adds new features to it.

Despite of the numerous features Angular provides, one should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages before start learning and using it. Let's discuss it in detail.

Following are the advantages of Angular framework −

TypeScript language− TypeScript provides type safety. Type safety reduces the bug by catching it early during the development phase and helps to create high quality application.

Full stack framework− Angular is a full stack framework supporting both client side and server-side rendering. It supports PWA application as well. It has builtin testing framework, dependency injection, reactive programming, template engine and data binding. It bundles the code efficiently to support fast rendering in the browser.

Easy to learn− Since angular has all the functionality to develop a modern application, developer dont need to search, analyze and learn different libraries. Also, Angular provides extensive documentation for all the feature along with code snippets for each and every version of the angular framework.

Easy to start− Angular provides CLI tool to quickly start a new application with basic setting. It supports routing and CSS preprocessor configuration as well.

Easy to develop− Angular provides CLI tools to create new components and directive. Angular component-based architecture, module-based design, reactive programming, data binding, routing and component-based framework enables the developer to program the application faster.

Easy to deploy− Angular provides builtin tools to compile and deploy the application. Angular team continuously enhances the build tools to improve the developer experience.

Easy to test− Angular provides end to end testing framework supporting all aspect of the angular features. Developer can write the spec for each component and test it.

Continuous development− Angular team continuously enhance the framework and provides the update in every 6 months. They improve the framework on every aspect and develop new feature in accordance with the improvements in web development.

The list given below explains the disadvantages of the Angular framework −

Little support for JavaScript language− Even though TypeScript is better programming language, little support for JavaScript leads developer to learn TypeScript before starting the Angular application and delays the adaptability of the Angular framework.

Steep learning curve− Since angular framework has lot of builtin concepts, it took considerable time to learn all aspect of the framework.

Hard to specialize− Developer needs lot of time and efforts to master the angular framework to write high performance application.

Low options− Being a full stack framework reduces the option in choosing the best library for the given task. Developer has to content with the functionality provided by the Angular team and has to wait for their preferred functionality to be developed by Angular team.

Low developer tools− Compared to React, Angular has less number of developer tools for debugging, profiling and testing the application.
