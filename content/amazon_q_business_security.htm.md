# Amazon Q Business - Security

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/amazon-q/amazon_q_business_security.htm

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority and Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you.

In this chapter we are going to learn  how to configure Amazon Q Business to meet your security and compliance objectives and also You'll learn to use AWS services to monitor and secure your Amazon Q Business resources.

Secure your AWS account by protecting credentials and setting up individual users with IAM Identity Center or IAM. Following are the way to secure your data:

Interface endpoints are AWS PrivateLink to access Amazon Q Business APIs privately, without an internet gateway, NAT, VPN, or Direct Connect. No public IP addresses needed.

You can create an interface endpoint for Amazon Q Business using either the Amazon VPC console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

Create an interface endpoint for Amazon Q Business using the following service name:

Use the AWS CLI command with the endpoint-url parameter to specify an interface endpoint to the Amazon Q Business API after creating a VPC endpoint.

A VPC endpoint is a DNS name generated when creating an interface endpoint, in the formatvpce-{ID}-{REGION}.qbusiness.{REGION}.vpce.amazonaws.com.

Enable private DNS to make API requests to Amazon Q Business using its default regional DNS name, e.g.,qbusiness.{REGION}.api.aws.

An endpoint policy is an IAM resource that you can attach to an interface endpoint. An endpoint policy specifies the following information:

Example:VPC endpoint policy for Amazon Q Business actions.

IAM Identity and Access Management is an AWS service that securely controls access to AWS resources, managing authentication and authorization, at no additional cost.

AWS compliance depends on data sensitivity, company objectives, and laws. AWS provides the following resources to help with compliance:

AWS has a global infrastructure with Regions and Availability Zones. These zones are separate, connected, and redundant, allowing you to build highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable applications that can automatically switch between zones without downtime.

Amazon Q Business is protected by the AWS global network security procedures. You use AWS published API calls to access Amazon Q Business through the network. Clients must support the following:

The confused deputy problem occurs when a less-privileged entity tricks a more-privileged one into performing an action it's not allowed to do.

Protect against the confused deputy problem by using aws:SourceArn with the full ARN or wildcard characters (*) for unknown portions.

If the aws:SourceArn value doesn't contain the account ID, such as an Amazon S3 bucket ARN, you must use both global condition context keys to limit permissions.

The value of aws:SourceArn must be ResourceDescription.

Use aws:SourceArn and aws:SourceAccount global condition context keys in Amazon Q Business to prevent the confused deputy problem.

AWS takes care of basic security tasks, such as updating the operating system and database, configuring firewalls, and recovering from disasters. These tasks have been checked and approved by trusted third parties.

Amazon Q Business offers security features to inform your security policies. Follow best practices as guidelines, not a complete solution, and adapt them to your environment.

Amazon Q uses IAM roles to control access to applications. Give roles only the necessary permissions for the job, and regularly review and update permissions as your application changes.

Administrators should strictly control role-based access control (RBAC) permissions for Amazon Q applications.
