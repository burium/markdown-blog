# Angular - Accessibility

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular/angular-accessibility.htm

Accessibilitysupport is one of the important feature of every UI based application. Accessibility is a way of designing the application so that, it is accessible for those having certain disabilities as well. Let us learn the support provided by Angular to develop application with good accessibility.

While using attribute binding, useattr.prefix for ARIA attributes.

Use Angular material component for Accessibility. Some of the useful components areLiveAnnouncerandcdkTrapFocu.

Use native HTML elements wherever possible because native HTML element provides maximum accessibility features. When creating a component, select native html element matching your use case instead of redeveloping the native functionality.

UseNavigationEndto track and control the focus of the application as it greatly helps in accessibility.
