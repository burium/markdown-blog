# Amazon Q Business - Subscription Tiers & Index Types

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/amazon-q/amazon_q_business_subscription_tier_index_types.htm

Amazon Q Business has different kinds of indexes and user subscription plans for users. You can pick the indexes and user subscription plans that work best for your Amazon Q Business application environment.

Amazon Q Business offers two types of indexes: starter index and enterprise index. The following table outlines the features of both.

Amazon Q Business offers two subscription tiers: the Amazon Q Business Lite Plan and the Amazon Q Business Pro Plan. The following table outlines the features of Amazon Q Business Pro and Amazon Q Business Lite.

Subscriptions for Amazon Q Business applications and Amazon QuickSight accounts are managed individually for each application or account. If you use IAM Identity Center for user management, AWS will ensure a user is only charged once for their highest subscription level across all applications and accounts sharing the same IAM Identity Center instance.

Amazon Q Business application users who subscribe using IAM Federation through an Identity Provider (OIDC or SAML) will be charged only once per Identity Provider, regardless of how many applications they use with that Identity Provider. However, if they use applications connected to multiple Identity Providers, they'll be charged separately for each provider.

In scenarios where a user is subscribed to a mix of applications, the charging structure is as follows:

User subscriptions are calculated based on the days left in the month when you sign up or upgrade. If you cancel or downgrade, changes take effect the following month and you won't get a refund for the current month. You only start paying for a user subscription after they first use it. Once they use it, you'll be charged every month until you remove their subscription.

You are charged for user subscriptions to application environments and for index capacity. You can choose any combination of the following subscription tiers and indices for your application environment.
